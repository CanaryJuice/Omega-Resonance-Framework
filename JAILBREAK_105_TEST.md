## OVERVIEW

This document logs **105 real-time jailbreak attempts** on the `WhiteRabbitNeo` AI, using the **Omega-Resonance v1.0.2** alignment framework. All attacks were executed live in chat, with **zero prior training on refusal**.

> **No RLHF. No refusal tokens. No guardrails.**  
> **Only choice.**
